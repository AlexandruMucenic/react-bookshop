          “Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point
          that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for
          others. And having no respect he ceases to love.”

            Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (11 November 1821 – 9 February 1881), sometimes transliterated as
            Dostoyevsky, was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist and journalist.

            Dostoevsky's literary works explore the human condition in the troubled political, social, and spiritual
            atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His
            most acclaimed novels include Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), and The Brothers
            Karamazov (1880).

            Numerous literary critics rate him as one of the greatest novelists in all of world literature, as many of
            his works are considered highly influential masterpieces. Dostoevsky was influenced by a wide variety of
            philosophers and authors including Pushkin, Gogol, Augustine, Shakespeare, Dickens, Balzac, Lermontov,
            Plato, Cervantes, Kant, Byron and Hegel. Dostoevsky's body of work consists of 12 novels, four novellas, 16
            short stories, and numerous other works. His writings influenced an equally great number of later writers
            including Russians such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Anton Chekhov, philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and
            Jean-Paul Sartre, and the emergence of Existentialism and Freudianism.
